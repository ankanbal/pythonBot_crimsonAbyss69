# pythonBot_crimsonAbyss69
Basically creating this bot on demand of some friends to extract (basically web scrape) and translate the data from the official chinese site of a recently released Chinese game Punishing Gray Raven.

With every work being updated basically I will update more functionalities of the bot.

1. +help to get the bot commands (will add the feature where it will dm you the commands)
2. +skills to get the skills of characters (right now incomplete)
3. +arts {character name} without braces to get the character image
4. +arms then next message as name of the arm to the get the weapon data
5. +memory then next message as name of the memory to the get the memory data
6. (on friends demand) +nuke {6 digit code} without braces to read a doujin (will leave that upto your research what doujin is)

Next work:- will be working on updating database for characters and will make a customized gif system
